# QUANTIUM_DATA_ANALYTICS_VIRTUAL_EXPERIENCE_R_STUDIO
In this project Quantium have partnered with a large supermarket brand who have provided transactional and costomer data. As the analyst I am tasked with delivering highly valued data analytics and insights to help the business make strategic decisions.  In this project I utilised my knowledge in R Studio and Powerpoint to show key analytic skills such as:  Data Wrangling, Data Visualisation, Programming Skills, Statistics, Critical Thinking, and Commercial Thinking

There are **3 tasks** assigned to this project:
- [Task 1: Data preparation and customer analytics](https://github.com/SiyamDodhiaAnalyst/Quantium-Data_Analytics_Virtual_Experience_RStudio/tree/main/Task%201)
  
  In this task I conduct analysis on my client's transactional dataset and identify customer purchasing behaviours to generate insights and provide commercial recommendations. I also perform high level data checks such as: 
   1. Creating and interpreting high level summaries of the data
   2. Finding outliers and removing these 
   3. Checking data formats and correcting 
- [Task 2: Experimentation and uplift testing](https://github.com/SiyamDodhiaAnalyst/Quantium-Data_Analytics_Virtual_Experience_RStudio/tree/main/Task%202)
  
  In this task I extend my analysis from Task 1 to help identify benchmark stores that allow me to test the impact of trial store layouts on customer sales. I am tasked with evaluating the performance of trial store 77 based on a calculated control store (in which I determined store 233 as the most suitable control store) based on 2 metrics:
    1. total sales revenue
    2. total number of customers
- [Task 3: Analytics and commercial application](https://github.com/SiyamDodhiaAnalyst/Quantium-Data_Analytics_Virtual_Experience_RStudio/blob/main/Task%203%20-%20Analytics%20and%20commercial%20application.pptx)

  In this final task I am using all the analytics and insights from Task 1 and 2 to prepare a report the client.
